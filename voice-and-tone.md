# Voice and Tone

**Context**

We are a group of technologists and activists who want to create a better digital world for everyone. We see the predatory business practices of Big Tech, recognize the inequity and pervasive damage they inflict on our society, and believe that we can do better. 

What are companies but the workers of which they consist? Rather than use our labor to the substantial benefit of a few at the top, we choose to work for the public good. Instead of prioritizing profits, we prioritize people.

We operationalize our values by creating mechanisms for democratic participation by everyone in our organization, infusing charitable giving into our budget, and building open-source software that anyone can freely use, copy, hack, and share.

Help us create a working model of a business that can be ethical, equitable, and successful.
